# Politeness and Coordination: Code for Paxton, Brown, & Winter (*in preparation*)

This repo contains the code for the analyses for our upcoming project analyzing
how power and politeness affect interpersonal movement synchrony during a
variety of interaction tasks (Paxton, Brown, & Winter, *in preparation*).

## Notes on viewing and running

For best viewing in a browser, we recommend selecting
`politeness_and_coordination.md`, rather than the similarly named .Rmd file.
(Analyses should be run using the .Rmd file of the same name.)

For those unfamiliar with R markdown, we recommend taking a look at [RStudio's
introduction to R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) before attempting
to run the `.Rmd` file. (Be sure to download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
first, if you do not already have it installed on your machine.)
